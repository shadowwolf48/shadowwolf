Glass will Host and Watch the games when we do such events, and will join if he wishes to. 
Play nice, don't cheat. Message Glass Shardzz to start up a Hide and Seek lobby with Multiple people. (At Least 10)
## Rules?
The only Rules are stay friendly, don't cheat/hack,
And don't fucking talk trash behind anyone's back. I don't care if they fucked your god damn mom.
It won't be tolerated, and there is good reason for it.
